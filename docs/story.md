# Kubeland and it's traffic control system

----
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away there was an intelligent species called **kuman**. They lived in a planet called **Planet-K**. Planet-K is the one and only habitable planet in the galaxy even in the galaxy cluster. All the kuman lived under one country called **kubeland**. The ruler of the country is known as **Captain-kube**.

As the time pass, kuman advance in technology. One day they invented a revolutionary vehicle called **kube-car**. With the help of **kube-car**, they build a country-wise transportation system. The peoples of kubeland were very happy. They loved their king **Captain-kube**.

Recently, a problem arises in kubeland. Some evil drivers has started to disobeying the traffic rule of kubeland. So, accident rate is rising. This made the peoples of kubeland anxious.

**Captain-kube** has noticed this problem. He ordered the department of transportation to build and advanced traffic control system to mitigate this problem. The department of transportation come up with an idea. They plan to set CCTV-camera on the roads. A **watcher team** will monitor the roads using those cameras. If any driver break any traffic rule, they will inform to **collector team**. The **collector team** will receive traffic rule violation reports and then send the reports to respective **traffic police**. The traffic police will take appropriate action against the respective driver.

After the plan was implemented, the evil drivers stopped violating traffic rules. So, the accident rate reduced to normal. The people of kubeland started to live happily again.
